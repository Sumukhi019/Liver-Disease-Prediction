# Liver Disease Prediction

## Overview
Liver diseases are emerging as a significant health threat in numerous countries, posing a growing burden on healthcare systems. Factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to harmful gasses, and ingestion of contaminated substances like food, pickles, and drugs contribute to the rising incidence of liver disease.

Liver damage resulting from various diseases typically carries irreversible consequences. However, early detection of liver disease coupled with appropriate intervention addressing its root cause can mitigate further deterioration. Treatment strategies hinge upon identifying the underlying cause and assessing the extent of damage. This project endeavors to discern optimal predictive models tailored to individual patient lifestyles and health profiles for early identification and management of liver disease.
